MenuExtended is an alternative menu building snippet for MODX Revolution.

It differentiates from common solutions such as Wayfinder by allowing multiple parents and
a possibility to define which parts of the tree to get per parent. It was also built from
scratch to offer better performance compared to other solutions.

MenuExtended is maintained by Mark Hamstra as an Open Source project on Github, so please
report any bugs or requests there (link below). Contributions are more than welcome in the
form of pull requests (also on Github).
