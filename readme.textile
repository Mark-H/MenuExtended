h2. What is MenuExtended?

MenuExtended is actually a simple alternative to "Wayfinder":http://rtfm.modx.com/display/ADDON/Wayfinder, the main menu builder every MODX Developer has worked with.

The reason this is called MenuExtended is cause there is extended control over what is displayed in the menu. It's probably also faster than Wayfinder in a lot of cases (tho I haven't run any real tests).

h2. When do you need to use MenuExtended?

The reason I developed it for a client was a main navigation that didn't match the resource tree. Both are proper for their contexts, but they simply don't work together and would require at least three Wayfinder/getResources calls to work properly.

This is the desired menu structure in that specific case:

* Shop Category 1
* Another shop Category
* Category tres
* Blog
* About Us
* * About the Company
* * The Team
* * Terms & Conditions

The problem is that the site structure totally didn't match that:

* Home
* Shop (ID 2)
** Shop Category 1
** Another shop Category
** Category tres
* Blog (ID 3)
** 2011 (auto generated)
** 2010 (auto generated)
* About Us (ID 4)
** About the Company
** The Team
** Terms & Conditions

So we would need to show:

1. The children of the Shop (ID 2) as level 1 items.
2. The "Blog" (ID 3) container - but not the children.
3. The "About Us" (ID 4) container and its children.

Good luck with that, Wayfinder!

So that's what MenuExtended does - it allows you to specify exactly what to include: the parent you specify, just its children or both.

It does lack extended support for contexts, twenty-bazillion configuration properties and processor intensive scripting.
